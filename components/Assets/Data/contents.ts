            we are superior to Java devs, but I digress. So I learnt C and C++ and thus came my awakening as I was truly \

            My first year was pretty productive for a nerd, but not for a normal social person, I joined IEEE ComSoc, created 2 games using Unity, C#, \
            some Embedded C and this weird thing called GitHub. But I made them and they were quite successful for my first projects."

            For the uninitiated, vim is a terminal based text editor, with very powerful macros and shortcut keys. It is from a family of editors \
            called Modal Editors. A blog on them coming soon. All this lead to 2 months of creating my own portable dotfile conf for beautiful terminals \
            and editors. Was it worth it....yesn't"
