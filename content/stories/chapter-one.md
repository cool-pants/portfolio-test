## Hey there!

Welcome to my first attempt at documenting my experiences. Let's first get the introductions out of the way...

I am **Mainak Sengupta**, a final year student as of 22nd July 2022. A pretty average student with a passion for learning new things and, more often than not, failing at them. So this is basically "101 ways not to approach life and coding", Indian Engineering student edition.

With that out of the way, let's put forth how this blog shall proceed, granted you wish to see more of my stupidity and maybe also get a few laughs out of them.

## Go read a book...

Statistical survey shows that about **73%** of university students don't exactly read books other than their own syllabus books and research papers.

Mainly due the fact that they probably have much more important things to spend their time on (like touching grass or something, I dunno I am a programmer).

Thus, I have decided to atleast keep the format of this like a book, so you can tell others that you indeed **ARE** reading a book.

And my source for this statistic, its simple...

## PG13

I am known in my friend circle for being unapologetically frank and to the point. And I sure won't be keeping a filter on for some internet blog.

This is just an heads up for any bad language and weird pop culture and meme references. Do bear with my bad attempt at humour which is, sadly, influenced **heavily** by reddit.

So be prepared lest your eyes be blasted by a horrible attempt at humour.

## What will I talk about

The main agenda of my blogs will be to talk about my **life**, **fitness** and **tech** journey.

### Life üåç

As said before, I can be said to be a fairly average kid in India. Not someone who is brilliant to the likes of the random 15 y/o with 10 degrees or someone with talent to consistently perform in a field.

Instead I have been known to be consistent in my performance as an above average student.

And I kid you not when I say that. I actually got the same rank throughout 4 years of school, **consistently**. I have no idea how.

But I digress; the main point being, I am just a kid trying to share the things I go through, and the experiences I had, which made me grow from a 17 y/o wimpy kid to a 21 y/o wimpy adult.

All in the hopes that it will help someone through some tough times, by getting a laugh or even a snicker out of them.

### Tech üíª

Yes I am an Engineering student. Yes I chose this method of suffering of my own free will. We exist.

**tl;dr** I like tech, like every other Engineering student. And like them I like to code as well. What a surprise.

But my main motivation to learn tech is.....
**I am lazy**

There, I said it. I am lazy and want to solve problems easily, why do stuff manually when you can just automate them.
Thus, begins my journey to try to automate stuff while breaking said stuff a million times along the way.

### Fitness üí™

This is something I am starting out right now as I slowly came to acknowledge the fact that 
**"Wow! maybe I am a fatass. And maybe I should change so that I don't die early..."**

A bit grim, I know. But a necessary wake up call nonetheless. So here I will generally share my journey to get jacked (hopefully).


## Conclusion

So that's me and my prologue. This is the beginning of what I would like to call a new arc of my life. The so called training arc, followed by the occassional beach episode.
If you do manage to stick around, I would do my best to keep you entertained while keeping stuff light.

Mainak Sengupta signing off.

Cheers üçª
